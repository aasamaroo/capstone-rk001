## Shilling Attack Detector for Recommendation Systems

This capstone project uses a hybrid CNN/LSTM Machine Learning Model which is trained using a dataset of reviews.
For this experiment, the Amazon 50K, and MovieLens 100K datasets were used.

Afterwards, a dataset with manipulated data is passed, and the detector is able to find the reviews that are a
result of a shilling attack. This detector is able to accurately and precisely find fake reviews generated
from attacks such as Bangwagon, Nuke, Average, Target User/Item, and Random attacks.

The technologies used were Jupyter Notebook, and this project was coded in Python.
